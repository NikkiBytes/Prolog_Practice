INSTALLATION

Step 1: install blip

 cd blip
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

Step 2: install go-perl (temporary - won't be required in future versions)

http://search.cpan.org/~cmungall/go-perl

Step 3: configure your prolog environemt

Make sure the logical paths amigo_src and amigo-conf are in your .plrc
or somewhere loaded at startup time

[TODO: this may eventually go somewhere like ~/.amigoplrc]

Add the following lines to your ~/.plrc

  user:file_search_path(amigo_src,'/users/cjm/cvs/bioprolog/apps/amigo/src').
  user:file_search_path(amigo_conf,'/users/cjm/cvs/bioprolog/apps/amigo/conf').

Changing path appropriately.

Step 4: Configure apache

You can use apache or any other web server - this is for serving the
images and css files. This is optional (though amigo will look
horrible without it)

 mkdir $WWWDOC_ROOT/amigo2
 cp -pR css $WWWDOC_ROOT/amigo2
 cp -pR images $WWWDOC_ROOT/amigo2
 sudo apachectl start

RUNNING

  export PATH="$HOME/cvs/bioprolog/apps/amigo/src:$PATH"
  run-amigod -p 8080 -i myont.obo

(you may need to edit the first line of run-amigod)

The first run will be slow shilst myont.obo is converted to a prolog
db (will be the file myon.pro_. Subsequent runs will use the prolog
db.

You can now access the db on http://127.0.0.1:8080/

ctrl-D to exit

Use the -bg option to run the server as a background process.

You can use a preconfigured setup:

  run-amigod -p 8080 -c conf_obd

See the conf dir for creating your own setup
