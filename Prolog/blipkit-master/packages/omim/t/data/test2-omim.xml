    <OMIM-ti>AARSKOG SYNDROME</OMIM-ti>
    <OMIM-tx>Grier et al. (1983) reported father and 2 sons with typical Aarskog
syndrome, including short stature, hypertelorism, and shawl scrotum.
They tabulated the findings in 82 previous cases. X-linked recessive
inheritance has been repeatedly suggested (see 305400). The family
reported by Welch (1974) had affected males in 3 consecutive
generations. Thus, there is either genetic heterogeneity or this is an
autosomal dominant with strong sex-influence and possibly ascertainment
bias resulting from use of the shawl scrotum as a main criterion.
Stretchable skin was present in the cases of Grier et al. (1983). Teebi
et al. (1993) reported the case of an affected mother and 4 sons
(including a pair of monozygotic twins) by 2 different husbands. They
suggested that the manifestations were as severe in the mother as in the
sons and that this suggested autosomal dominant inheritance. Actually,
the mother seemed less severely affected, compatible with X-linked
inheritance.</OMIM-tx>

    <OMIM-tx>A number sign (#) is used with this entry because abdominal aortic
aneurysm is a multifactorial disorder with multiple genetic and
environmental risk factors. The disorder may occur as part of a
heritable syndrome or in isolation. Loci for isolated abdominal aortic
aneurysm have been mapped to 19q13 (AAA1; 609781) and 4q31 (AAA2;
609782).

CLINICAL FEATURES

Loosemore et al. (1988) described 2 brothers with abdominal aortic
aneurysm at ages 58 and 62 years, whose father died of ruptured
abdominal aortic aneurysm at the age of 72 years. Four other sibs died
of myocardial infarction at ages 47 to 61 years. Loosemore et al. (1988)
suggested that a deficiency of type III collagen (see 120180) might be
the basis for the aneurysm formation. The proportion of type III
collagen in forearm skin biopsies was cited as accurately reflective of
the proportion in the aorta and was said to have been low in the
brothers.

Ward (1992) looked for association of dilated peripheral arteries with
aortic aneurysmal disease by measuring the diameters of the common
femoral, popliteal, brachial, common carotid, internal carotid, and
external carotid arteries by color-flow duplex scan in 30 control
subjects and 36 patients with aortic aneurysm matched for age, sex,
smoking habits, and hypertension. Mean peripheral artery diameter was
significantly greater in patients with aortic aneurysms than in controls
at all measurement sites. Peripheral artery dilatation was identified at
sites that are seldom, if ever, involved in atherosclerosis. Ward (1992)
concluded that there is a generalized dilating diathesis in aortic
aneurysmal disease that may be unrelated to atherosclerosis.

In the study of Verloes et al. (1995), familial male cases showed a
significantly earlier age at rupture and a greater rupture rate as
compared with sporadic male cases, as well as a tendency (p less than
0.05) towards earlier age of diagnosis.

AAA occurs among approximately 1.5% of the male population older than 50
years of age. Several studies have indicated an increased frequency
among first-degree relatives of patients with AAA. Aneurysms of the
peripheral arteries (femoral, popliteal, and isolated iliac) are less
common than aortic aneurysms (Lawrence et al., 1995), and arteriomegaly
(diffuse aneurysmal disease) is even less common (Hollier et al., 1983).
Peripheral aneurysms and arteriomegaly carry a high risk for
complications such as rupture, embolism, or thrombosis.

INHERITANCE

Tilson and Seashore (1984) reported 50 families in which abdominal
aortic aneurysm had occurred in 2 or more first-degree relatives, mainly
males. In 29 families, multiple sibs (up to 4) were affected; in 2
families, 3 generations were affected; and in 15 families, persons in 2
generations were affected. Three complex pedigrees were observed: one in
which both parents and 3 sons were affected; one in which a man and his
paternal uncle were affected; and one in which a man and his father and
maternal great-uncle were affected. In the 'one-generation' families,
there were 3 with only females affected, including a set of identical
twins. The authors concluded that if a single gene is responsible, it is
likely to be autosomal but that a multigenic mechanism cannot be
excluded.

Clifton (1977) reported 3 affected brothers.

In North Carolina, Johnson et al. (1985) found that white males have a
frequency of abdominal aortic aneurysm about 3 times that in black
males, black females, or white females; all 3 of the latter groups had
about comparable frequencies. Frequency was ascertained by a survey of
autopsies and a survey of abdominal computed tomographic scans in
subjects over the age of 50 years.

Johansen and Koepsell (1986) compared the family histories of 250
patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm with those of 250 control
subjects. Among the control subjects, 2.4% reported a first-degree
relative with an aneurysm, compared with 19.2% of the patients with
abdominal aortic aneurysm. This was taken to represent an estimated
11.6-fold increase in abdominal aortic aneurysm risk among persons with
an affected first-degree relative. The authors suggested that
noninvasive screening to detect early abdominal aortic aneurysm may be
warranted in the relatives of affected persons.

Borkett-Jones et al. (1988) brought to 4 the number of reported sets of
identical twins concordant for abdominal aortic aneurysm. In a 9-year
prospective study of 542 consecutive patients undergoing operation for
abdominal aortic aneurysm, Darling et al. (1989) found that 82 (15.1%)
had a first-degree relative with an aneurysm as compared to 9 (1.8%) of
the control group of 500 patients of similar age and sex without
aneurysmal disease. Patients with familial abdominal aortic aneurysm
were more likely to be women (35% vs 14%), and men with familial
abdominal aortic aneurysm tended to be about 5 years younger than the
women. No significant difference was found between the patients with
nonfamilial and familial abdominal aortic aneurysms in anatomic extent,
multiplicity, associated occlusive disease, or blood type. The risk of
rupture was strongly correlated with familial disease and the presence
of a female member with aneurysm (63% vs 37%). Darling et al. (1989)
suggested the term 'black widow syndrome' because of the grim
significance of the presence of an affected female in the family.

On the basis of a study of first-degree relatives of 91 probands,
Majumder et al. (1991) rejected the nongenetic model and concluded that
the most parsimonious genetic model was that susceptibility to abdominal
aortic aneurysm is determined by a recessive gene at an autosomal
diallelic major locus.

Fitzgerald et al. (1995) assessed the incidence of abdominal aortic
aneurysm (AAA) in the sibs of 120 patients known to have AAA. Twelve
percent of the sibs were found to have an aneurysm, including 22% of
male sibs but only 3% of female sibs. Male sibs with hypertension were
more likely to have AAA.

In the study of Verloes et al. (1995), relative risk for male sibs of a
male patient was 18. Segregation analysis with the mixed model gave
single gene effect with dominant inheritance as the most likely
explanation for the familial occurrence. The frequency of the morbid
allele was 1:250, and its age-related penetrance was not higher than
0.4.

As part of a review of abdominal aortic aneurysm as a multifactorial
process, Henney (1993) reviewed family studies and the molecular
genetics. In a review focused on surgical aspects, Ernst (1993)
commented that 'there is little support for atherosclerosis as the
unitary cause...several factors appear to have an important role,
including familial clustering...'

Through questionnaire and telephone inquiries, Verloes et al. (1995)
collected family data on 324 probands with abdominal aortic aneurysm and
determined multigenerational pedigrees on 313 families, including 39
with multiple affected patients. There were 276 sporadic cases (264 men;
12 women); 81 cases belonged to multiplex pedigrees (76 men; 5 women).

Baird et al. (1995) collected information from 126 probands with
abdominal aortic aneurysm and 100 controls (cataract surgery patients)
concerning AAA. Of 427 sibs of probands, 19 (4.4%) had probable or
definite AAA, compared with 5 (1.1%) of 451 sibs of controls. The
lifetime cumulative risks of AAA at age 83 were 11.7% and 7.5%,
respectively. The risk of AAA began at an earlier age and increased more
rapidly for probands' sibs than for controls' sibs. The risk comparison,
based on the results of ultrasound screening of 54 geographically
accessible sibs probands and the 100 controls, showed a similar pattern.
AAA was found on ultrasound in 10 sibs of probands, or 19%, compared to
8% of controls.

Lawrence et al. (1998) constructed pedigrees for first-degree relatives
of 140 patients who received the diagnosis of peripheral arterial
aneurysm, arteriomegaly, or AAA from 1988 through 1996 in Salt Lake
City, Utah. Patients with peripheral arterial aneurysm (n = 40) had a
10% (4 of 40) familial incidence rate of an aneurysm, patients with AAA
(n = 86) had a 22% (19 of 86) familial incidence rate, and patients with
arteriomegaly (n = 14) had a 36% (5 of 14) familial incidence rate. AAA
was the aneurysm diagnosed most commonly among first-degree relatives
(86%; 24 of 28). Most aneurysms (85%) occurred among men. Lawrence et
al. (1998) suggested that relatives of patients with AAA, peripheral
arterial aneurysm, or arteriomegaly may be screened by means of a
physical examination for peripheral aneurysmal disease. Screening by
means of ultrasound examination of the aorta should be limited to
first-degree relatives of patients with aortic aneurysms or
arteriomegaly.

Rossaak et al. (2000) cited a familial incidence of 11 to 20% for AAA.

Kuivaniemi et al. (2003) identified 233 families with at least 2
individuals diagnosed with abdominal aortic aneurysms. The families
originated from 9 different nationalities, but all were white. There
were 653 aneurysm patients in these families, with an average of 2.8
cases per family. Most of the families were small, with only 2 affected
individuals. There were, however, 6 families with 6, 3 with 7, and 1
with 8 affected individuals. Most of the probands (82%) and the affected
relatives (77%) were male, and the most common relationship to the
proband was brother. Most of the families (72%) appeared to show an
autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, whereas in 58 families (25%),
abdominal aortic aneurysms were inherited in an autosomal dominant
manner, and in 8 families, the familial aggregation could be explained
by autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. In the 66
families where abdominal aortic aneurysms were inherited in a dominant
manner, 141 transmissions of the disease from 1 generation to another
were identified, and male-to-male, male-to-female, female-to-male, and
female-to-female transmissions occurred in 46%, 11%, 32%, and 11%,
respectively. Kuivaniemi et al. (2003) concluded that abdominal aortic
aneurysms are a multifactorial disorder with multiple genetic and
environmental risk factors.

PATHOGENESIS

Newman et al. (1994) and others have pointed to a role of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMPs) in end-stage AAA. MMP activity is closely
controlled by the balance of its activators, such as plasmin, and its
inhibitors. A mutation that reduces the transcription of plasminogen
activator inhibitor (PAI1; 173360) would result in an increase in the
activity of tissue plasminogen activator (PLAT; 173370). This in turn
would increase the conversion of inactive plasminogen (173350) to its
active form, plasmin, and increase the zymogen activation of MMPs.
Jean-Claude et al. (1994) observed increased levels of plasmin in AAAs.

It is possible that aneurysms develop due to structural alterations in
extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as elastin (130160), collagens,
and proteoglycans. Such alterations in type III collagen (see 120180),
however, have been shown to be rare causes of both abdominal aortic
aneurysms and intracranial aneurysms (see 105800). Another alternative
is that the enzymes degrading the structural molecules contribute to
aneurysm formation. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are connective
tissue-degrading enzymes that could play a role in structural
alterations of the arterial wall through the degradation of collagens
and other extracellular matrix molecules. MMP3 (185250), MMP9 (120361),
and PAI1 are present at increased levels in abdominal aortic aneurysms
(Yoon et al., 1999). Promoters of these genes contain polymorphisms with
alleles that exhibit different transcriptional activities in vitro.

Tromp et al. (2004) determined the relative expression of MMP13 (600108)
in aortic tissue samples from 36 patients who underwent abdominal aortic
aneurysm repair operations and from 20 nonaneurysmal autopsy samples.
MMP13 was expressed in all parts of the aorta, and its expression was
elevated in the aneurysmal sac. In further studies using MMP13-specific
antibody, Tromp et al. (2004) demonstrated that MMP13 protein was
present in the aneurysmal wall.

Yoshimura et al. (2005) observed a high level of phosphorylated JNK
(MAPK8; 601158) in human AAA tissue. By DNA microarray analysis of rat
aortic vascular smooth muscle cells, they demonstrated that Jnk programs
a gene expression pattern that cooperatively enhances degradation of the
extracellular matrix, while suppressing biosynthetic enzymes of the ECM,
such as Lox (153455) and Plod1 (153454). In human monocyte-macrophage
cells and AAA tissue, JNK played a role in MMP9 secretion. Selective
inhibition of Jnk in vivo not only prevented the development of AAA but
also caused regression of established AAA in 2 mouse models. Yoshimura
et al. (2005) concluded that JNK is a proximal signaling molecule in the
pathogenesis of AAA that acts by promoting abnormal ECM metabolism.

Kontusaari et al. (1989) and Kontusaari et al. (1990) reported a
mutation in the COL3A1 gene (120180.0004) that may be the cause of
familial aortic aneurysms. See review of Kuivaniemi et al. (1991). Tromp
et al. (1993) carried out detailed DNA sequencing of the triple-helical
domain of type III procollagen on cDNA prepared from 54 patients with
aortic aneurysms. In the case of 43 patients, at least 1 additional
blood relative had aneurysms. The 43 males and 11 females originated
from 50 different families and 5 different nationalities. Only one amino
acid substitution likely to have functional significance, a
gly136-to-arg mutation, was found (see 120180.0018). Results indicated
that mutations in type III procollagen are the cause of only about 2% of
aortic aneurysms.

A 4G/5G single nucleotide insertion/deletion polymorphism -675 bp
upstream from the initiation of transcription in the PAI1 gene
(173360.0002) has been described (Dawson et al., 1993). The 4G allele
binds only an activator, whereas the 5G allele binds an activator and a
repressor and is associated with a relatively reduced transcription of
PAI1. The 5G variant is associated with less inhibition of the
plasminogen activators and, consequently, increased conversion of
plasminogen to plasmin and increased activation of MMPs. Thus, patients
with this variant may be more at risk of the development of AAA. Rossaak
et al. (2000) studied the ratios of the 4G:5G genotypes in 190 patients
with AAA, including 39 patients with strong family histories, and 163
controls. The frequency of the 4G:5G alleles in the AAA population and
in the control population was 0.6:0.4. However, 26% of patients with
familial AAA were homozygous 5G compared with 13% of the control
population. The 4G allele frequency was 0.47 in the familial AAAs,
compared with 0.62 in the nonfamilial patients (P = 0.02) and 0.61 in
the control population (P = 0.03). There are suggestions from several
sources that AAA and atherosclerosis may be different diseases. In their
AAA population, Rossaak et al. (2000) found an incidence of diabetes
mellitus of 6%. They suggested that this relatively low incidence in
patients with AAA contrasted with that in atherosclerotic disease and
lent support to the notion that these 2 disorders are indeed distinct.
The association of the 5G homozygous genotype with familial AAA was
another observation that questioned the idea that atherosclerosis causes
AAAs. Whereas the 4G variant of PAI1 shows a protective role in AAA, it
is undesirable in the context of coronary artery disease and
atherosclerosis (Harris, 2001).

Yoon et al. (1999) performed association studies using polymorphisms in
the MMP3 (185250), MMP9 (120361), and PAI1 (173360) genes and DNA
isolated from 47 AAA patients, 57 intracranial aneurysm (IA) patients,
and 174 controls, all from Finland. PAI1 and MMP9 genotypes did not
associate with aneurysms. The frequency of the 5A MMP3 allele
(185250.0001) was somewhat higher in the AAA than in the control group,
whereas the MMP3 allele frequencies in the IA group did not differ from
those of the controls. These findings suggested that the
transcriptionally more active 5A MMP3 allele might be a genetic risk
factor for AAA among Finns. The findings were in agreement with previous
studies demonstrating higher levels of MMP3 expression in AAA than in
control tissues.

Histologically, AAAs are characterized by signs of chronic inflammation,
destructive remodeling of the extracellular matrix, and depletion of
vascular smooth muscle cells (Steinmetz et al., 2003). Ogata et al.
(2005) hypothesized that genes involved in these events could harbor
changes and make individuals more susceptible to aneurysms. They
reported studies that identified significant genetic associations
between DNA sequence changes in the tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1; 305370), TIMP3 (188826), matrix
metalloproteinase-10 (MMP10; 185260) and elastin (ELN; 130160) and AAA.

POPULATION GENETICS

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is, of course, a common disorder; by
ultrasound screening, Collin et al. (1988) found an abdominal aortic
aneurysm in 5.4% of men aged 65 to 74, and in 2.3% of men in this age
group the aneurysm was 4 cm or more in diameter.</OMIM-tx>

    <OMIM-tx>This condition was first described by Frolich (1839). The appellation
'prune belly syndrome' is descriptive because the intestinal pattern is
evident through the thin, lax, protruding abdominal wall in the infant
(Osler, 1901). (Osler did not use the term 'prune belly.' His article on
this subject and one 'on a family form of recurring epistaxis,
associated with multiple telangiectases of the skin and mucous
membranes'--see 187300--appeared successively in the November 1901 issue
of the Johns Hopkins Hospital Bulletin. Osler wrote: 'In the summer of
1897 a case of remarkable distension of the abdomen was admitted to the
wards, with greatly distended bladder, and on my return in September,
Dr. Futcher, knowing that I would be interested in it, sent for the
child.') The full syndrome probably occurs only in males (Williams and
Burkholder, 1967). Multiple cases (of the full syndrome) in families
have rarely been reported, and the mode of inheritance, indeed whether
this is a mendelian condition, is still unclear. Autosomal recessive
inheritance is suggested by some reports. In Lebanon, where the rate of
consanguinity is high, Afifi et al. (1972) described an affected
offspring of first-cousin parents. Garlinger and Ott (1974) described 2
affected brothers in 1 family and 2 affected male cousins in a second,
and found 3 other reports of affected sibs, 2 of affected cousins and 1
of concordant male twins. In the first family the parents were
nonconsanguineous. In the second family the affected boys' mothers were
half sisters; they had different maternal grandmothers. If this is an
X-linked recessive, multiple affected brothers should be observed. If
the disorder is due to fresh dominant mutation in each case, the
male-limitation would be unexpected but not impossible. In British
Columbia, Baird and MacDonald (1981) found a frequency of 1 in 29,231
live births. This malformation syndrome is similar to Poland syndrome
(173800) in being rather consistently reproduced in many cases but
having no clearly demonstrable mendelian basis. A possibly related
syndrome was described in a single patient by Texter and Murphy (1968).
The triad consisted of absence of the right testis, kidney, and rectus
abdominis muscle. King and Prescott (1978) presented evidence to support
the suggestion that the maldevelopment of the abdominal musculature and
abdominal laxity are secondary phenomena, the primary event being marked
distention of the abdomen in the fetal period because of obstruction of
the urinary tract. Likewise, Pagon et al. (1979) suggested that the
abdominal muscle deficiency is secondary to fetal abdominal distention
of various causes, most often perhaps, urethral obstruction with
enlarged bladder. 'Prune belly' occurs, in the main, as a consequence of
posterior urethral valves; thus the predominance as a male-limited
multifactorial trait. Gaboardi et al. (1982) reported 2 brothers and a
sister with prune belly syndrome with bilateral hydronephrosis,
megaureter and megabladder, but no urethral stenosis. A better prognosis
than is usually thought to obtain was suggested by the series of 19
patients reported by Burke et al. (1969). Greskovich and Nyberg (1988)
gave a review in which they stated incorrectly that the term prune belly
syndrome was coined by Osler.</OMIM-tx>

    <OMIM-syn>ADAMS-OLIVER SYNDROME</OMIM-syn>
    <OMIM-syn>AOS</OMIM-syn>
    <OMIM-tx>The proband described by Adams and Oliver (1945) had absence of the
lower extremities below the mid-calf region and absence of all digits
and some of the metacarpals of the right hand; a denuded ulcerated area
on the vertex of the scalp present at birth; and a bony defect of the
skull underlying the scalp defect. The skin and skull lesions were
similar to those of aplasia cutis congenita (107600, 207700). The
proband had 4 unaffected brothers and a sister and brother with
identical defects of limb, scalp and skull. The father was born with
absence of toes 2-5 on the left foot, with short terminal phalanges of
all fingers, and with a scalp defect. The father was 1 of 10 children of
whom 3 others had defects of the extremities. The father's father was
said to have had short fingers. The proband's parents were not related.
In a family described by Scribanu and Temtamy (1975), variable
expressivity and reduced penetrance were evident; cutis marmorata was
striking in the proband, a 3-year-old male. Toriello et al. (1988) also
described cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (CMTC; 219250) in a
child with the Adams-Oliver syndrome. The mother also had CMTC without
the other features of the Adams-Oliver syndrome. These vascular changes
in the skin may indicate that the features of Adams-Oliver syndrome are
'vascular disruption sequences.' The family reported by Bonafede and
Beighton (1979) added substantial support to dominant inheritance, with
one instance of male-to-male transmission. Kuster et al. (1988)
described 10 cases, 7 of them in 2 families and 3 sporadic cases. They
found 11 families and 19 sporadic cases reported in the literature. They
suggested that the important differential diagnoses are the syndrome of
scalp defect and postaxial polydactyly (181250), the amniotic band
sequence (which is usually nonmendelian), and the Bart type of
epidermolysis bullosa dystrophica (132000).

Koiffmann et al. (1988) recorded an experience which suggested autosomal
recessive inheritance of a disorder identical to the autosomal dominant
form. Their patient had the congenital scalp defect with hypoplastic
fingers and toes. The parents were unaffected first cousins. Among 7
sibs, 3 sisters and 2 brothers were normal, whereas 2 brothers born with
the same scalp defect died as a consequence of bleeding from this
abnormal area.

Sybert (1989) concluded that 'most, if not all, instances of isolated
ACC of the scalp are the result of an autosomal dominant gene, that ACC
of the body wall + limb defects is an extremely heterogeneous group
among which there may be inherited disorders of all Mendelian types as
well as sporadic and nongenetic causes, and that ACC limited to the
scalp in association with limb defects is most often inherited as an
autosomal dominant.' Sybert (1985) and Frieden (1986) gave comprehensive
reviews. Jaeggi et al. (1990) reported an affected mother and child as
well as a third sporadic case. They discussed the probable pathogenesis
of the disorder by vascular disruption as suggested by Toriello et al.
(1988). Cutis marmorata and dilated scalp veins further point to a
vascular disorder. Jaeggi et al. (1990) stated that among the 31
reported patients with the full syndrome, major hemorrhage from the
scalp defect occurred in 10, with 2 fatalities. Local infection was
noted in 7 babies, with 1 case of fatal meningitis. Only 30% of the
patients had surgical treatment of their scalp defects by skin grafting.
Der Kaloustian et al. (1991) described 2 families having members
affected with the Poland anomalad and the Adams-Oliver syndrome. They
hypothesized that the Poland anomalad and the Adams-Oliver syndrome
result from the interruption of early embryonic blood supply in the
subclavian arteries, and that the gene predisposing to this interruption
follows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Hoyme et al.
(1992) reported that 2 additional individuals in family 2 of Der
Kaloustian et al. (1991) had the Poland sequence with no findings
suggesting Adams-Oliver syndrome. Whitley and Gorlin (1991) provided a
follow-up on the family studied by Adams and Oliver (1945); the gene had
been transmitted to a member of a fourth generation. They found reports
of 81 cases in 32 families with approximately equal distribution between
males and females. Vertical transmission in at least 8 families was
consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. Despite large defects of
the cranium, central nervous system abnormalities have not been found in
this disorder and intellectual development appears to be normal. On the
basis of a sporadic case in a 10-year-old male, Chitayat et al. (1992)
suggested that acrania is a severe form of aplasia cutis congenita and
is within the spectrum of Adams-Oliver syndrome. In acrania, the flat
bones of the cranial vault are absent, whereas the bones at the base of
the skull are normal. Bamforth et al. (1994) found this syndrome in a
mother and her 3 children with variable scalp defects and limb defects.
Other anomalies included congenital heart disease, microcephaly,
epilepsy, mental retardation, arhinencephaly, hydrocephaly, anatomic
bronchial anomalies, and renal anomalies. The 3 children were by 2
different fathers.

Zapata et al. (1995) reported 2 patients with Adams-Oliver syndrome and
congenital cardiac malformations. A literature review demonstrated that
13.4% of individuals with this syndrome have congenital heart anomalies.

Farrell et al. (1993) described a sporadic case of this syndrome in a
male infant. In addition to typical manifestations, he had atrial septal
defect, chylothorax, and chronic juvenile myelogenous leukemia which was
diagnosed at 9 months. Review of the literature (102 cases) showed that
78% of patients had defects of lower limbs and 59% had defects of upper
limbs. To avoid ascertainment bias, Farrell et al. (1993) excluded
propositi for calculations of scalp and skull defects. After this
exclusion, 56% of patients had scalp defects and 21% had skull defects.

Pousti and Bartlett (1997) described cutis aplasia congenita in twin
boys born to a mother with a history of cutis aplasia. One of the
infants had associated distal limb anomalies, and the other had cardiac
anomalies.

Klinger and Merlob (1998) suggested autosomal recessive inheritance for
the disorder in a brother and sister born of nonconsanguineous parents.
Other explanations are, of course, possible, and perhaps more likely.
The brother had scalp aplasia cutis congenita and cutis marmorata; his
sister had these features associated with terminal lower limb defects.
She showed short upper limbs, short feet, and brachydactyly of toes 2 to
4. Oligohydramnios had been a feature of both pregnancies. The family
reported by Kahn and Olmedo (1950) was pointed to as another example of
recessive inheritance. Tekin et al. (1999) reported a Turkish family
with 2 affected sibs and unaffected consanguineous parents as further
evidence of recessive inheritance in at least some families.

Swartz et al. (1999) described the case of a young girl with
Adams-Oliver syndrome who also had double-outlet right ventricle, portal
hypertension, and pulmonary hypertension. They hypothesized that a
congenital vascular abnormality is the underlying pathogenesis and that
the cutaneous defects characteristically seen in AOS represent the most
common manifestations. They suggested that AOS should be considered not
merely a syndrome consisting of aplasia cutis congenita and terminal
transverse limb defects but rather a constellation of clinical findings
resulting from an early embryonic vascular abnormality. No cases of
double-outlet right ventricle had been reported in AOS. Toriello et al.
(1988) described pulmonary hypertension in association with pulmonary
vein stenosis. Portal hypertension caused by hepatoportal sclerosis had
also not been reported in AOS. Pulmonary hypertension developed in the
patient described by Swartz et al. (1999) before the age of 4 years.

As further evidence that the Adams-Oliver syndrome is a vascular
disruption sequence, Keymolen et al. (1999) reported the case of a girl
with congenital scalp and acral reduction limb defects, consistent with
the diagnosis of Adams-Oliver syndrome, who also showed constriction
rings, making the limb anomalies similar to those seen in the amniotic
band disruption sequence (217100).

Savarirayan et al. (1999) described a boy with AOS whose sister was also
mildly affected. Their mother had hypoplastic fifth toenails, thought to
represent very mild expression of the syndrome. Computed tomography of
the brain to investigate mild left hemiparesis in the boy demonstrated
severe cortical dysplasia of central, occipital, and anterior regions of
the right cerebral hemisphere. The boy and his sister had apparent
constriction rings present on the toes, an uncommon finding in AOS.

Pereira-da-Silva et al. (2000) described 2 patients with AOS, one of
whom had necrotic lesions of the fingertips, generalized cutis marmorata
telangiectatica, and localized ulceration of the abdominal skin,
indicative of a vascular abnormality.

Amor et al. (2000) reported 2 sibs, born of consanguineous parents, with
cortical malformations and scalp and limb defects consistent with
Adams-Oliver syndrome. Both sibs showed global developmental delay, and
brain imaging showed polymicrogyria and dilatation of the cerebral
ventricles. One child developed lymphedema of 1 leg. Amor et al. (2000)
suggested that the sibs had a rare variant of AOS with autosomal
recessive inheritance.

Patel et al. (2004) described 2 children with AOS and additional
features, including intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), CMTC,
pulmonary hypertension, intracranial densities (shown in 1 patient to be
sites of active bleeding), and osteopenia. Autopsy in 1 patient showed
defective vascular smooth muscle cell/pericyte coverage of the
vasculature associated with 2 blood vessel abnormalities. Pericyte
absence correlated with vessel dilatation whereas hyperproliferation of
pericytes correlated with vessel stenosis. These findings suggested a
unifying pathogenic mechanism for the abnormalities seen in AOS. Patel
et al. (2004) concluded that the 2 patients they described, in addition
to those reported by Toriello et al. (1988) and Swartz et al. (1999),
established that a subset of AOS patients is at high risk for pulmonary
hypertension.

Maniscalco et al. (2005) reported a father and son with AOS and
pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (PAVMs). Manifestations of AOS in
this 3-generation family included scalp defect, digital hypoplasia
and/or syndactyly, and cutis marmorata telangiectasia. The authors
suggested that the occurrence of PAVM in AOS supports the hypothesis
that endothelial-specific abnormalities could be the pathophysiologic
mechanism for the development of AOS.

Verdyck et al. (2006) presented a Belgian family in which 10 individuals
over 4 generations had Adams-Oliver syndrome, 6 of whom were available
for study. Clinical symptoms were variable as reported in other families
and included large areas of alopecia on the vertex of the skull and
serious limb reduction defects with agenesis of all toes of 1 foot. In a
search for the disease-causing gene, they sequenced the following 5
genes in this family and in 9 previously reported families, finding no
disease-causing mutations: MSX1 (142983), CART1 (601527), P63 (603273),
RUNX2 (600211), and HOXD13 (142989).</OMIM-tx>

    <OMIM-ti>ACANTHOSIS NIGRICANS</OMIM-ti>
    <OMIM-tx>Acanthosis nigricans consists of thickening and hyperpigmentation of the
skin of the entire body but especially in flexural areas. In 26 patients
with malignant acanthosis nigricans (secondary to visceral carcinoma),
Curth and Aschner (1959) found no other affected persons in the family.
On the other hand, benign acanthosis nigricans may be inherited as a
mendelian dominant. Curth and Aschner (1959) had families with
acanthosis nigricans in successive generations, 3 in 1 family and 2 in 2
others, including instances of male-to-male transmission. Jung et al.
(1965) observed affected mother and daughter. Lawrence et al. (1971)
described a patient with acanthosis nigricans inherited from the father
and telangiectasia (187300) inherited from the mother. Tasjian and
Jarratt (1984) observed affected mother and daughter. Skin lesions were
first noted in infancy. In addition to the association with insulin
resistance (147670), Seip syndrome (269700), and malignancy, acanthosis
nigricans can be drug-induced; nicotinic acid, diethylstilbestrol, oral
contraceptives, and exogenous glucocorticoids have been incriminated.
Clear mendelian inheritance is seen when acanthosis nigricans is part of
syndromes, e.g., Seip syndrome. Autosomal dominant acanthosis nigricans
should be studied for insulin resistance. Schwenk et al. (1986) studied
a white family in which acanthosis nigricans occurred in a mother and 3
daughters; insulin binding was normal but insulin response was reduced,
consistent with a postbinding defect (see 147670). Perhaps one should
speak of types A1 and A2 of acanthosis nigricans, A1 being the form with
a defect in the insulin receptor and A2 representing a postbinding
defect. Seemanova et al. (1992) investigated a family in which at least
4 men in 3 generations had a syndrome of obesity, mild mental
retardation, delayed puberty, macroorchidism, acanthosis nigricans,
hyperinsulinemia, and, later, overt insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus
(noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes; see NIDDM,
125853). The patients had markedly curly scalp hair and deficient hair
of the face and body. Teeth were normal. There was normal insulin
binding to fibroblasts; however, insulin-stimulated RNA synthesis was
decreased as compared to that of normal control individuals, suggesting
a postbinding defect in insulin action. The pedigree showed an autosomal
dominant pattern of inheritance.

Acanthosis nigricans in association with insulin resistance behaves as
either a dominant (e.g., 147670.0001) or a recessive (e.g.,
147670.0004). The polycystic ovary syndrome is sometimes reported. The
autosomal dominant mutations in the insulin receptor gene are 'dominant
negatives'; the mutant receptor protein interferes with the function of
the normal receptor.

Chuang et al. (1995) reported familial acanthosis nigricans affecting a
35-year-old woman, her 7-year-old son, and 5-year-old daughter. Absence
of the eyebrows and eyelashes was also present in the affected members
of this family. The mother had no axillary hair and her pubic hair was
sparse. The boy also suffered from congenital heart disease and a
congenital cataract in the left eye. Chuang et al. (1995) suggested that
the combination of acanthosis nigricans and ectodermal defects in this
family may represent a distinct nosologic entity. They referred to the
hair problem as madarosis (loss of the eyebrows or of the eyelashes).

Using data from 397 participants from 2 Mexican-American family studies,
Burke et al. (2000) investigated the heritability of acanthosis
nigricans and its genetic correlation with other diabetes risk factors.
They examined acanthosis nigricans as both a continuous trait and a
dichotomous trait by means of a previously described validated scale.
The results indicated that the heritability for the condition, when
examined as a continuous trait, was high (0.58 +/- 0.10) and
statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The heritability as a
dichotomous trait was estimated to be moderate (0.23 +/- 0.05) and was
also significant (P = 0.018). The additive genetic correlations between
acanthosis nigricans and type 2 diabetes and its risk factors, including
body mass index and fasting insulin, were high or moderately high and
statistically significant. The random environmental correlations, by
contrast, were low and statistically insignificant. These data suggested
that genes that influence acanthosis nigricans have pleiotropic effects
on diabetes and its risk factors.</OMIM-tx>

    <OMIM-tx>Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (EC 1.2.1.3) is the next enzyme after alcohol
dehydrogenase (103700) in the major pathway of alcohol metabolism. On
the basis of population studies of isozyme patterns, Harada et al.
(1978) proposed that there are 3 loci determining acetaldehyde
dehydrogenase. They suggested that the rarer of the alleles at the
postulated ALDH1, ALDH2 and ALDH3 loci have a frequency of 0.022, 0.029
and 0.151, respectively. The sample numbered only 68 specimens, however.

Harada et al. (1980) presented evidence that aldehyde dehydrogenase is
polymorphic in Japanese. As in previous studies in Europeans, they found
2 isozymes of ALDH in liver specimens of Japanese, but unlike the study
of specimens of Europeans, they found that 52% of Japanese specimens
showed absence of the faster migrating isozyme (which has a low Km for
acetaldehyde). The authors suggested that the intoxicating symptoms
after alcohol drinking in many Japanese may be due to delayed oxidation
of acetaldehyde. The lack of ALDH isozyme I with a low Km for aldehyde
is apparently responsible for the higher blood acetaldehyde levels in
mongoloid peoples, leading to facial flushing and other vasomotor
symptoms after alcohol intake. Agarwal et al. (1981) performed a
population genetic study in Orientals of several different extractions.
They investigated ALDH isozymes in hair root lysates with a sensitive
isoelectric focusing method. Between 40 and 80% of the several Oriental
groups were found to be deficient in isozyme I of ALDH, whereas not a
single European individual was deficient. Deficiency was invariably
associated with sensitivity to alcohol. Family studies suggested
autosomal recessive inheritance of the deficiency. Harada et al. (1981)
found the deficiency in 43% of Japanese; all deficient persons had
flushing symptoms and, after alcohol drinking, showed a mean
concentration of acetaldehyde of 37.3 micromoles as compared with 2.1
micromoles in nondeficient persons.

Thomas et al. (1982) found low cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase in
the liver of alcoholic patients with fatty liver; mitochondrial ALDH was
normal. Abstaining alcoholics showed persistently low cytosolic ALDH.
Isoelectric focusing showed that the cytosolic and mitochondrial ALDHs
are distinct isozymes. Impraim et al. (1982) investigated the basis of
the lack in about 50% of Orientals of 1 of the 2 major liver ALDH
isozymes. Consistent with a convention of nomenclature adopted by the
HGM workshops, ALDH1 is cytosolic and ALDH2 is mitochondrial. It is the
latter that is missing in Orientals. Inoue et al. (1979) purified and
partially characterized aldehyde dehydrogenase from human erythrocytes.
This is the cytosolic form, present in only low concentration in red
cells. Goedde et al. (1979) proposed that the high frequency of acute
alcoholic intoxication in Orientals is related to the high frequency of
persons with absence of ALDH2 liver isozyme. On the other hand,
Stamatoyannopoulos et al. (1975) suggested that the racial difference in
alcohol intoxication is due to rapid acetaldehyde formation as a result
of the highly active atypical alcohol dehydrogenase isozyme found in
high frequency in Orientals. ALDH1 and ALDH2 have molecular weights of
245,000 and 225,000, respectively, and both are tetramers. Structural
and genetic interrelationships are unknown; e.g., does each consist of a
single type subunit or do they share a common subunit? Impraim et al.
(1982) found that the ALDH2 in an 'atypical' Japanese liver was
enzymatically inactive but immunologically cross-reactive. Thus, a
structural mutation at the ALDH2 locus is presumably the genetic basis.

Goedde et al. (1983) pointed to the existence of 4 isozymes of
NAD-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase, designated ALDH I, II, III, or IV
according to their decreasing electrophoretic mobility and increasing
isoelectric point. The frequency of absent ALDH I isozyme varied from
69% in Indians of the Ecuador Highlands to 44% in Japanese and 35% in
Chinese to 0% in Egyptians, Liberians, Kenyans, and Europeans. They
suggested that deficiency is related to flushing and a slower metabolism
of acetaldehyde, and in turn a lower frequency of alcoholism and
alcohol-related problems.

Yoshida et al. (1989) demonstrated that among Caucasians alcohol
flushing can be related to abnormalities of ALDH1. In 9 unrelated
Caucasian alcohol flushers, they found 1 who exhibited low activity
(10-20% of normal) and another who exhibited moderately low activity
(60%) and altered kinetic properties. The electrophoretic mobilities of
these 2 samples were not altered. Immunologic quantitation indicated
that the amount of protein in the 2 samples was not reduced in parallel
with the enzyme deficiency. In the first case, the daughter of the
proposita also had very low enzyme activity and alcohol flushing.

ALDH1 is cytosolic, is associated with a low Km for NAD and a high Km
for acetaldehyde, and is strongly inactivated by disulfiram. ALDH2
(100650) is mitochondrial, has a high Km for NAD and a low Km for
acetaldehyde, and is insensitive to disulfiram. About 50% of Orientals
lack ALDH2 activity but have defective enzyme immunologically related to
ALDH2 (Yoshida et al., 1984). In some Orientals absence of ALDH1
activity and the presence of an enzymatically inactive protein is
demonstrable (Yoshida et al., 1983). Yoshida (1984) concluded that one
can substitute hair roots for liver biopsy specimens if sample size for
isoelectric focusing is adjusted using MDH or IDH as an internal
reference. The liver of humans and other mammals contains 2 major and
several minor aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes. The major isozymes are
ALDH1 of cytosolic origin and ALDH2 of mitochondrial origin. (The
confusion in the numbering of the aldehyde dehydrogenases is evident.
ALDH I and ALDH II of Goedde and colleagues is ALDH2 and ALDH1 of other
workers.) In contrast to the wide prevalence of deficiency of ALDH2
(called ALDH I by Goedde), variants of ALDH1 (called ALDH II by Goedde)
are rare; Eckey et al. (1986) described one such variant.

With cDNA probes for Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids, Hsu
et al. (1985, 1986) assigned the ALDH1 locus to 9q and the ALDH2 locus
to chromosome 12. Hsu et al. (1989) found that the ALDH1 gene is about
53 kb long and is divided into 13 exons which encode 501 amino acid
residues. A similar intron-exon organization is found in ALDH2 which
also has 13 exons with 9 of the 12 introns interrupting the coding
sequence at positions homologous to those in ALDH1. Thus, the 2 isozymes
appear to have evolved after duplication of a common ancestral gene.</OMIM-tx>

    <OMIM-tx>See 100640. Almost all Caucasians have 2 major ALDH isozymes in the
liver: a cytosolic ALDH1 and a mitochondrial ALDH2 (EC 1.2.1.3). On the
other hand, about 50% of Orientals are missing the ALDH2 isozyme.
Impraim et al. (1982) showed that the livers of such persons show an
enzymatically inactive but immunologically cross-reactive material (CRM)
corresponding to the ALDH2 isozyme. The remarkable difference in
Orientals of 2 alcohol-metabolizing enzymes, ADH2 (103720) and ALDH2,
cannot have been coincidence. Ikuta et al. (1986) suggested that the
explanation is coadaptation to an environment, such as particular diet,
to which Orientals were exposed, since ADH and ALDH are complementary in
the metabolic pathway of various alcohols. Fenna et al. (1971) concluded
that ethanol is metabolized significantly faster in whites than in
Eskimos or American Indians, but Bennion and Li (1976) could find no
evidence that this is the case. Wolff (1972) demonstrated that members
of the Mongoloid race, after drinking amounts of alcohol that have no
detectable effect on Caucasoids, respond with marked facial flushing and
mild to moderate symptoms of intoxication. Wolff (1972) believed that
group differences, which are present at birth, were attributable to
differences in autonomic reactivity. Absence of the enzyme coded by
ALDH2, frequent in Mongoloid persons, 'causes' alcohol intolerance
(Goedde et al., 1979). Individuals lacking the enzyme suffer the
alcohol-flush reaction when they drink alcoholic beverages. The reaction
is the result of excessive acetaldehyde accumulation, and the unpleasant
symptoms tend to reduce alcohol consumption. The lower incidence of
alcoholism in certain Mongoloid groups may have its basis in these
observations.

Hsu et al. (1985) assigned the ALDH2 locus to chromosome 12 by means of
a cDNA probe and Southern blot analysis of somatic cell hybrids. With a
cDNA fragment corresponding to the 3-prime-coding part of human ALDH-1
mRNA, Braun et al. (1986) studied human-rodent somatic cell hybrids to
confirm the assignment to chromosome 12. (The cytosolic form is on
chromosome 9; see 100640.) The mitochondrial and cytosolic forms of ALDH
are coded by mouse chromosomes 4 and 19, respectively (Mather and
Holmes, 1984). Comparative mapping in man, mouse, and bovine led Womack
(1990) to suggest that ALDH2 is in the distal part of 12q, distal to
IFNG (147570), a conclusion consistent with other information on the
mapping of these 2 loci.

The ALDH2 alleles encoding the active and inactive subunits are termed
'ALDH2*1' and 'ALDH2*2,' respectively; see 100650.0001. It had been
thought that the 2 alleles were expressed codominantly, and that only
individuals homozygous for ALDH2*2 were ALDH2-deficient. However,
studies of the inheritance of alcohol-induced flushing in families
suggested that the trait is dominant (Schwitters et al., 1982). Crabb et
al. (1989) did genotyping on the liver from 24 Japanese individuals,
using the PCR technique for amplification of genomic DNA. In correlating
genotype with phenotype, they found that both heterozygotes and
homozygotes for ALDH2*2 are deficient in ALDH2 activity; that is, the
ALDH2*2 allele is dominant. Since ALDH2 is a homotetrameric enzyme,
random association of active and inactive subunits, equally expressed,
should generate about 6% normal tetramers; the remainder would contain
at least 1 mutant subunit. Thus, if all tetramers containing at least 1
mutant subunit were inactive, there would be only 6% activity in
heterozygotes. This low amount of activity is likely to be below the
detection limit of activity staining of the gels. Hsu et al. (1987)
developed a method for distinguishing the 2 main alleles by means of
allele-specific 21-base synthetic oligonucleotides. Shibuya et al.
(1988) studied 23 Japanese with alcoholic liver disease. No difference
was found in the genotypes at the ADH2 locus. However, at the ALDH2
locus, 20 of the 23 patients were homozygous for the Caucasian type,
only 3 were heterozygous, and none of the patients was homozygous for
the Oriental type. The results were interpreted as indicating that
Japanese with the atypical allele are at a much lower risk for alcoholic
liver disease, presumably due to their sensitivity to alcohol
intoxication. By means of a pair of synthetic oligonucleotides, 1
complementary to the usual ALDH2 allele and the other complementary to
the atypical ALDH2 allele, Shibuya and Yoshida (1988) determined the
genotypes of 49 unrelated Japanese persons and 12 Caucasians. The
frequency of the atypical allele was found to be 0.35 in the Japanese
samples examined. The atypical gene was not found in the Caucasians.
Using allele-specific oligonucleotides for ALDH2*2, Singh et al. (1989)
studied phenotypically deficient individuals in the Chinese, Japanese,
and South Korean families to determine heterozygous or homozygous
status. All individuals with a heterozygous genotype were found to be
deficient, thus demonstrating that only the normal homotetrameric enzyme
is catalytically active. As suggested by other workers, a random
tetramerization of the 2 allele products will result in a residual
enzyme activity of 6.25% of the normal value in heterozygotes if both
normal and mutant subunits are produced in the same proportions. In
these studies ALDH phenotype was determined in hair roots, and DNA was
prepared from peripheral blood. Exon 12 of the gene was amplified by PCR
for subsequent allele-specific hybridization.

Crabb (1990) pointed out that the single base mutation in ALDH2,
responsible for acute alcohol-flushing reaction in Asians, is the
best-characterized genetic factor influencing alcohol drinking behavior.
He raised the possibility that polymorphism in the several alcohol
dehydrogenase genes might be related to risk of fetal alcohol syndrome
(FAS). It is noteworthy that a genetic influence in fetal alcohol
syndrome is suggested by twin studies: Streissguth and Dehaene (1993)
established that the rate of concordance for the diagnosis of fetal
alcohol syndrome was 5 out of 5 for monozygotic and 7 out of 11 for
dizygotic twins. In 2 DZ pairs, one twin had FAS, while the other had
fetal alcohol effects (FAE). In 2 other DZ pairs, one twin had no
evident abnormality, while the other had FAE. IQ scores were most
similar within pairs of MZ twins and least similar within pairs of DZ
twins discordant for diagnosis. Johnson et al. (1996) documented the
central nervous system anomalies of FAS by magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI). CNS and craniofacial abnormalities were predominantly symmetric
and central or midline. The authors stated that the association
emphasized the concept of the midline as a special developmental field,
vulnerable to adverse factors during embryogenesis and fetal growth and
development.

Thomasson et al. (1991) hypothesized that the polymorphisms of both of
the liver enzymes responsible for the oxidative metabolism of ethanol
may modify the predisposition to development of alcoholism. Using
leukocyte DNA amplified by PCR and allele-specific oligonucleotides in a
study of Chinese men living in Taiwan, they demonstrated that alcoholics
had significantly lower frequencies not only of ALDH2*2 but also of
ADH2*2 (103720.0001) and ADH3*1 (103730.0001). Goedde et al. (1992) gave
extensive population frequency data on ALDH2 as well as on ADH2. They
again showed that the atypical ALDH2 gene (ALDH2*2) is extremely rare in
Caucasoids, Negroids, Papua New Guineans, Australian Aborigines, and
Aurocanians (South Chile), but widely prevalent among Mongoloids. They
cited evidence indicating that individuals possessing the ALDH2*2 allele
show alcohol-related sensitivity responses such as facial flushing, are
usually not habitual drinkers, and appear to suffer less from alcoholism
and alcohol-related liver disease.

Muramatsu et al. (1995) used the PCR/RFLP method to determine the
genotypes of the ADH2 and ALDH2 loci of alcoholic and nonalcoholic
Chinese living in Shanghai. They found that the alcoholics had
significantly lower frequencies of the ADH2*2 and ALDH2*2 alleles than
did the nonalcoholics, suggesting the inhibitory effects of these
alleles for the development of alcoholism. In the nonalcoholic subjects,
ADH2*2 had little, if any, effect, despite the significant effect of the
ALDH2*2 allele in decreasing the alcohol consumption of the individual.
Taken together, these results were considered consistent with the
proposed hypothesis for the development of alcoholism, i.e., drinking
behavior is greatly influenced by the individual's genotype of
alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and the risk of becoming alcoholic is
proportionate with the ethanol consumption of the individual.

The ALDH2*2 allele is considered to be a genetic deterrent for
alcoholism; however, Muramatsu et al. (1996) found that 80 of 655
Japanese alcoholics had the mutant allele. The authors postulated that
these alcoholics had some other factor that overcame the adverse effects
of acetaldehydemia and that such a factor might reside in the brain's
'reward system,' in which dopamine plays a crucial role. Muramatsu et
al. (1996) studied variation at the DRD4 locus (126452) and found a
higher frequency of a 5-repeat allele of the DRD4 receptor 48-bp repeat
polymorphism in alcoholics with ALDH2*2 than in 100 other alcoholics and
144 controls. They found that alcoholics with the 5-repeat allele also
abused other drugs more often.

The genes that encode the major enzymes of alcohol metabolism, i.e.,
alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, exhibit functional
polymorphism. The variant alleles ADH2*2 (103720.0001) and ADH3*1
(103730.0001), which encode high-activity ADH isoforms, and the ALDH2*2
allele (100650.0001), which encodes the low-activity form of ALDH2,
protect against alcoholism in East Asians. To investigate possible
interactions among these protective genes, Chen et al. (1999) genotyped
340 alcoholic and 545 control Han Chinese living in Taiwan at the ADH2,
ADH3, and ALDH2 loci. After the influence of ALDH2*2 was controlled for,
multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that allelic variation
at ADH3 exerts no significant effect on the risk of alcoholism. Any
presumed affect could be accounted for by linkage disequilibrium between
ADH3*1 and ADH2*2; the 2 genes are located on 4q22. ALDH2*2
homozygosity, regardless of the ADH2 genotype, was fully protective
against alcoholism; no individual showing such homozygosity was found
among the alcoholics. Logistic regression analyses of the remaining 6
combinatorial genotypes of the polymorphic ADH2 and ALDH2 loci indicated
that individuals carrying 1 or 2 copies of ADH2*2 and a single copy of
ALDH2*2 had the lowest risk (odds ratios = 0.04-0.05) for alcoholism, as
compared with the ADH2*1/*1 and ALDH2*1/*1 genotypes. The disease risk
associated with the ADH2*2/*2-ALDH2*1/*1 genotype appeared to be about
half of that associated with the ADH2*1/*2-ALDH2*1/*1 genotype. These
results suggested that protection afforded by the ADH2*2 allele may be
independent of that afforded by ALDH2*2.

Oota et al. (2004) used the ALDH2*2 allele, which is responsible for
catalytic deficiency of ALDH2, and 4 noncoding SNPs to study ALDH2
haplotype frequency and linkage disequilibrium in 37 worldwide
populations. Only 4 major SNP-defined haplotypes were found to account
for almost all chromosomes in all populations. A fifth haplotype
harbored the functional variant and was found only in East Asians.

Chai et al. (2005) examined ADH2, ADH3, and ALDH2 polymorphisms in 72
alcoholic and 38 nonalcoholic healthy Korean men. Forty-eight of the
alcoholic men had Cloninger type 1 and 24 had Cloninger type 2
alcoholism. The frequency of ADH2*1 (103720.0001) and ADH3*2
(103730.0002) alleles was significantly higher in men with type 2
alcoholism than in men with type 1 alcoholism and in healthy men. The
frequency of the ALDH2*1 allele was significantly higher in men with
alcohol dependence than in healthy men. Chai et al. (2005) suggested
that the genetic characteristics of alcohol metabolism in type 1
alcoholism falls between nonalcoholism and type 2 alcoholism.

Using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO-9) containing the
5-prime-TCCC-3-prime motif, which acts by greatly reducing mRNA levels,
Garver et al. (2001) showed that rat hepatoma cells had reduced Aldh2
mRNA levels and activity, resulting in more than 90% inhibition of Aldh2
synthesis, probably mediated by RNase H hydrolysis. Mismatches in the
TCCC motif, in particular, reduced the efficacy of ASO-9, which
specifically reduced mRNA levels of Aldh2 but not of a control
mitochondrial enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GLUD1; 138130). Treatment
of rats with ASO-9 specifically reduced Aldh2 activity by approximately
40% and increased plasma acetaldehyde levels 4-fold after ethanol
administration. Behavioral analysis indicated that ASO-9 treatment
induced an aversion to ethanol. After initial consumption, a reduction
of 61% in ethanol consumption was observed in treated rats, a level
comparable to that achieved with disulfiram (Antabuse). Garver et al.
(2001) concluded that the specificity and lack of side effects of an ASO
that inhibits ALDH2 expression and mimics the Asian phenotype would be
advantageous when compared with disulfiram.

Kazmierczak et al. (1995) found that the ALDH2 gene was a translocation
partner of the HMGIC gene (HMGA2; 600698) in a uterine leiomyoma. Fusion
genes involving HMGIC are found in pleomorphic adenomas of salivary
glands and in a variety of benign mesenchymal tumors.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

ANIMAL MODEL

Nitroglycerine, or glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), elicits nitric oxide
(NO)-based signaling to dilate blood vessels. Chen et al. (2005) found
that mitochondrial bioconversion of GTN to NO was absent in mitochondria
obtained from Aldh2-null mice. Vasoactivity from alternative
nitro(so)vasodilators was unaffected. GTN bioactivity could still be
generated in mutant mice and their isolated vascular tissue, but only at
substantially higher concentrations of GTN. Chen et al. (2005) concluded
that ALDH2 is necessary and sufficient for vasoactivity derived from
therapeutic levels of GTN.</OMIM-tx>

The ALDH2*2-encoded protein has a change from glutamic acid (glutamate)
to lysine at residue 487 (Yoshida et al., 1984). Hempel et al. (1985)
and Hsu et al. (1985) also showed that the catalytic deficiency in
mitochondrial ALDH in Orientals can be traced to a structural point
mutation at amino acid position 487 of the polypeptide. A substitution
of lysine for glutamic acid results from a transition of G-C to A-T.

To study the mechanism by which the ALDH2*2 allele exerts its dominant
effect in decreasing ALDH2 activity in liver extracts and producing
cutaneous flushing when the subject drinks alcohol, Xiao et al. (1995)
cloned ALDH2*1 cDNA and generated the ALDH2*2 allele by site-directed
mutagenesis. These cDNAs were transduced using retroviral vectors into
HeLa and CV1 cells, which do not express ALDH2. The normal allele
directed synthesis of immunoreactive ALDH2 protein with the expected
isoelectric point and increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The
ALDH2*2 allele directed synthesis of mRNA and immunoreactive protein,
but the protein lacked enzymatic activity. When ALDH2*1-expressing cells
were transduced with ALDH2*2 vectors, both mRNAs were expressed and
immunoreactive proteins with isoelectric points ranging between those of
the 2 gene products were present, indicating that the subunits formed
heteromers. ALDH2 activity in these cells was reduced below that of the
parental ALDH2*1-expressing cells. Thus, the authors concluded that
ALDH2*2 allele is sufficient to cause ALDH2 deficiency in vitro.

Xiao et al. (1996) referred to the ALDH2 enzyme encoded by the ALDH2*1
allele (the wildtype form) as ALDH2E and the enzyme subunit encoded by
ALDH2*2 as ALDH2K. They found that the ALDH2E enzyme was very stable,
with a half-life of at least 22 hours. ALDH2K, on the other hand, had an
enzyme half-life of only 14 hours. In cells expressing both subunits,
most of the subunits assemble as heterotetramers, and these enzymes had
a half-life of 13 hours. Thus, the effect of ALDH2K on enzyme turnover
is dominant. Their studies indicated that ALDH2*2 exerts its dominant
effect both by interfering with the catalytic activity of the enzyme and
by increasing its turnover.

Because genetic epidemiologic studies have suggested a mechanism by
which homozygosity for the ALDH2*2 allele inhibits the development of
alcoholism in Asians, Peng et al. (1999) recruited 18 adult Han Chinese
men, matched by age, body-mass index, nutritional state, and
homozygosity at the ALDH2 gene loci from a population of 273 men. Six
individuals were chosen for each of the 3 ALDH2 allotypes, i.e., 2
homozygotes and 1 heterozygote. Following a low dose of ethanol,
homozygous ALDH2*2 individuals were found to be strikingly responsive
with pronounced cardiovascular hemodynamic effects as well as subjective
perception of general discomfort for as long as 2 hours following
ingestion.

Among 71 Japanese nondrinkers and 268 drinkers of alcohol, Liu et al.
(2005) found that drinkers had a significantly higher frequency of the
487glu allele. Individuals with the 487lys allele had an increased risk
of alcohol-induced flushing (odds ratio of 33.0).</OMIM-av>

      <OMIM-mutation-text>The ALDH2*2-encoded protein has a change from glutamic acid (glutamate)
to lysine at residue 487 (Yoshida et al., 1984). Hempel et al. (1985)
and Hsu et al. (1985) also showed that the catalytic deficiency in
mitochondrial ALDH in Orientals can be traced to a structural point
mutation at amino acid position 487 of the polypeptide. A substitution
of lysine for glutamic acid results from a transition of G-C to A-T.

To study the mechanism by which the ALDH2*2 allele exerts its dominant
effect in decreasing ALDH2 activity in liver extracts and producing
cutaneous flushing when the subject drinks alcohol, Xiao et al. (1995)
cloned ALDH2*1 cDNA and generated the ALDH2*2 allele by site-directed
mutagenesis. These cDNAs were transduced using retroviral vectors into
HeLa and CV1 cells, which do not express ALDH2. The normal allele
directed synthesis of immunoreactive ALDH2 protein with the expected
isoelectric point and increased aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. The
ALDH2*2 allele directed synthesis of mRNA and immunoreactive protein,
but the protein lacked enzymatic activity. When ALDH2*1-expressing cells
were transduced with ALDH2*2 vectors, both mRNAs were expressed and
immunoreactive proteins with isoelectric points ranging between those of
the 2 gene products were present, indicating that the subunits formed

    <OMIM-tx>See 100640. In stomach tissue, Teng (1981) described an isozymic form of
aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). It did not use formaldehyde,
acetaldehyde, or pyruvic aldehyde. Furfuraldehyde and, to a lesser
extent, propionaldehyde were readily oxidized. Teng (1981) found 1
genetic variant among 71 Chinese stomach specimens and a second
different variant among 33 Asiatic Indian specimens. Unlike liver ALDH,
which appears to be a tetramer, the electrophoretic pattern in the
heterozygotes suggested that stomach ALDH is a monomer. ALDH3 is also
present in lung. By study of somatic cell hybrids, Santisteban et al.
(1985) assigned the ALDH3 gene to chromosome 17.

Using PCR with primers based on conserved regions of aldehyde
dehydrogenases, Hsu et al. (1992) isolated ALDH3 clones from a human
stomach cDNA library. The ALDH3 open reading frame encodes a protein of
453 amino acids. The ALDH3 gene consists of 10 exons spanning
approximately 8 kb. Human ALDH3 protein is 81% identical to that of
ALDH3 from rat hepatocarcinoma cells. By analysis of Northern blots and
PCR products, Hsu et al. (1992) found that ALDH3 is transcribed at high
levels in human stomach and in hepatoma cells, but at very low levels in
normal liver. ALDH3 protein expressed in E. coli exhibited kinetic
properties similar to that of ALDH3 purified from human stomach and
liver.

Data on gene frequencies of allelic variants were tabulated by
Roychoudhury and Nei (1988).

By in situ hybridization, Hiraoka et al. (1995) mapped the ALDH3 gene to
17p11.2. Rogers et al. (1997) found that ALDH3 is 50 to 85 kb from a
closely related gene, ALDH10 (270200), and stated that the close
linkage, sequence similarity (66% identity between the coding sequences,
excluding the final 35 codons unique to ALDH10), and structural
conservation indicate that the 2 genes share a common origin.

Vasiliou et al. (1999) reviewed eukaryotic aldehyde dehydrogenase genes,
tabulated allelic variants in the human, and recommended nomenclature
based on divergent evolution and chromosomal mapping. They considered
ALDH3 a 'trivial' designation and suggested ALDH3A1 as the official
symbol.

ALDH3 constitutes 20 to 40% of the total water-soluble proteins in
mammalian cornea. Kays and Piatigorsky (1997) showed by Northern blot
analysis that ALDH3 expression in the mouse is at least 500-fold higher
in the cornea than in any other tissue examined, with very low levels of
expression detected in stomach, urinary bladder, ocular lens, and lung.
Histochemical localization showed that this exceptional level of
expression in the mouse cornea occurs in the anterior epithelial cells,
and that little ALDH3 is present in the keratocytes or corneal
endothelial cells. As the anterior-most layer of the cornea, the
epithelium is faced with continual impingement by environmental
stressors, such as UV radiation, that can have deleterious effects on
cellular function. The abundant expression of ALDH3 in the corneal
epithelium is believed to play a role in protecting this vital tissue,
as well as the rest of the eye, from damage generated by UV exposure.
With a demonstrated substrate preference for the medium-length aliphatic
aldehyde products of UV-induced lipid peroxidation, ALDH3 is thought to
be responsible for preventing the accumulation of these toxic products
in the cornea. In addition to its detoxification function, ALDH3 may
protect the eye by the direct absorption of UV radiation. The high
UV-absorbing capacity of ALDH3, which is attributed both to its high
tryptophan content and to its ability to bind NAD, led some
investigators to term this major corneal protein 'absorbin.'

Kays and Piatigorsky (1997) showed that a promoter fragment derived from
the mouse ALDH3 gene is capable of targeting expression of the
chloramphenicol acetyltransferease (cat) reporter gene specifically to
the epithelial layer of the cornea in transgenic mice, mimicking the
expression pattern of the endogenous ALDH3 gene. Together with other
results, the experiments indicated that tissue-specific expression of
ALDH3 is determined by positive and negative elements in the 5-prime

    <OMIM-tx>The 2 aldehyde dehydrogenase isozymes that play a major role in ethanol
detoxification, ALDH1 (100640) and ALDH2 (100650), are cytosolic and
mitochondrial forms, respectively. Their organization is basically
similar; their sizes are 53 kb and 44 kb, respectively, and both contain
13 coding exons interrupted by 12 introns of comparable lengths. Hsu et
al. (1989) cloned a new ALDH gene from a cosmid human DNA library.
Although it contains no introns, Northern blot hybridization of human
liver RNA revealed a unique mRNA component that hybridized with this
gene probe but with neither the ALDH1 probe or the ALDH2 probe. The new
gene encoded 517 amino acid residues, suggesting that it is similar to
ALDH2, and indeed its deduced sequence was 70.6% identical to that of
ALDH2 and only 62.8% identical to that of ALDH1. Hsu et al. (1989)
assigned the ALDH5 gene to chromosome 9 by Southern blot analysis of
rodent-human hybrid cell DNAs. Hsu and Chang (1991) provided a full
report on this gene which they referred to as ALDHx.

By in situ hybridization, Hiraoka et al. (1995) mapped the ALDH5 gene to
9p13.</OMIM-tx>

    <OMIM-ti>ACETAMINOPHEN METABOLISM</OMIM-ti>
    <OMIM-tx>Acetaminophen (paracetamol) is extensively conjugated with glucuronic
acid and sulfate before renal excretion. A minor metabolic route
involves microsomal oxidation of acetaminophen to a hepatotoxic reactive
intermediate, which subsequently undergoes glutathione (GSH)
conjugation, yielding cysteine and mercapturate conjugates, both of
which are excreted in the urine (Slattery et al., 1987). Evidence was
presented by de Morais et al. (1989) that, in comparison with normal
subjects, glucuronidation of acetaminophen is impaired in subjects with
Gilbert syndrome (143500), a disorder in which glucuronidation of
bilirubin is impaired. In studies of 125 Caucasian and 33 Oriental
subjects, Patel et al. (1992) found no difference in the mean fraction
of acetaminophen excreted as glucuronide: 51.5% in Caucasians versus
51.8% in Orientals. However, bimodality was apparent in both groups,
with 20% of Caucasians and 33% of Oriental subjects displaying
relatively extensive glucuronidation. In addition, glucuronidation
displayed a strong negative correlation with sulfation (r = -0.97),
suggesting a compensatory or complementary relationship between the 2
metabolic pathways. The mean fractional excretions of cysteine and
mercapturate conjugates between Caucasians and Orientals did show
significant differences (p = less than 0.005).</OMIM-tx>
