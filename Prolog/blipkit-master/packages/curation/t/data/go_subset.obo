def: "A cell that is found in almost all tissues containing numerous basophilic granules and capable of releasing large amounts of histamine and heparin upon activation. Progenitors leave bone marrow and mature in connective and mucosal tissue. Mature mast cells are found in all tissues, except the bloodstream. Their phenotype is CD117-high, CD123-negative, CD193-positive, CD200R3-positive, and FceRI-high. Stem-cell factor (KIT-ligand; SCF) is the main controlling signal of their survival and development." [GOC:add, GOC:dsd, GOC:tfm, ISBN:068340007X, MESH:A.11.329.427, MESH:D008407, PMID:15153310, PMID:16330751, PMID:16455980, PMID:18483499, PMID:19671378, PMID:9354811]
comment: Mast cells are generally integrin beta-7-negative and positive for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7, TLR9, C3aR, C5aR, CR3, CR4, VEGF, FGF2, and renin. They can express MHC Class I and II on their surface. Activated murine mast cells (IgE+Antigen) were capable of expressing the following co-stimulatory molecules: CD95 (Fas), CD120b, CD137 (4-1BB), CD153 (CD30L), CD154 (CD40L), GITR, ICOSL, OX40L, PD-L1, and PD-L2. Note that there was some mouse strain variation. Mast cells have also been demonstrated to produce bFGF, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCL11, CCL20, CXCL2, CXCL10, GM-CSF, IFN-gamma, IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-8, IL-10, IL-11, IL-12, IL-13, IL-16, IL-25, IL-18, MIP-1, prostaglandin D2, SCF, TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, TSLP, VEGF, and XCL1. They express the transcription factors GATA-1 and MITF.

comment: From FMA: n9.07.2001: Endothelial cell has always been classified as a kind of epithelial cell, specifically a squamous cell but that is not true. First, endothelial cell can either be squamous or cuboidal (e.g. high-endothelial cell) and secondly, it has different embryological derivation (mesodermal) than a true epithelial cell (ectodermal and endodermal). The basis for present classifiaction is the fact that it comprises the outermost layer or lining of anatomical structures (location-based) but a better structural basis for the differentia is the cytoskeleton of the cell. Endothelial cell has vimentin filaments while an epithelial cell has keratin filaments. [Onard]

To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word \"promoter\" in GO, we have chosen the phrase \"transcription regulatory region\" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the \"core promoter\" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the \"core promoter proximal region\" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and \"enhancer\" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to \"transcription regulatory region DNA binding\" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider \"sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity\" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of \"transcription regulatory region DNA binding\".

def: "A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions." [ISBN:0198506732]
comment: Note that the Golgi apparatus can be located in various places in the cytoplasm. In plants and lower animal cells, the Golgi apparatus exists as many copies of discrete stacks dispersed throughout the cytoplasm, while the Golgi apparatus of interphase mammalian cells is a juxtanuclear, often pericentriolar reticulum, where the discrete Golgi stacks are stitched together to form a compact and interconnected ribbon, sometimes called the Golgi ribbon.

def: "An intracellular organelle, about 200 A in diameter, consisting of RNA and protein. It is the site of protein biosynthesis resulting from translation of messenger RNA (mRNA). It consists of two subunits, one large and one small, each containing only protein and RNA. Both the ribosome and its subunits are characterized by their sedimentation coefficients, expressed in Svedberg units (symbol: S). Hence, the prokaryotic ribosome (70S) comprises a large (50S) subunit and a small (30S) subunit, while the eukaryotic ribosome (80S) comprises a large (60S) subunit and a small (40S) subunit. Two sites on the ribosomal large subunit are involved in translation, namely the aminoacyl site (A site) and peptidyl site (P site). Ribosomes from prokaryotes, eukaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts have characteristically distinct ribosomal proteins." [ISBN:0198506732]

Actin filaments are a major component of the contractile apparatus of skeletal muscle and the microfilaments of the cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells. The filaments, comprising polymerized globular actin molecules, appear as flexible structures with a diameter of 5-9 nm. They are organized into a variety of linear bundles, two-dimensional networks, and three dimensional gels. In the cytoskeleton they are most highly concentrated in the cortex of the cell just beneath the plasma membrane." [GOC:mah, ISBN:0198506732, PMID:10666339]

def: "The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal, e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor activation by a stimulus such as light, and ends with regulation of a downstream cellular process, e.g. regulation of transcription or regulation of a metabolic process. Signal transduction covers signaling from receptors located on the surface of the cell, and signaling via molecules located within the cell. For signaling between cells, signal transduction is restricted to events at and within the receiving cell." [GOC:go_curators]
comment: Note that signal transduction is defined broadly to include a ligand interacting with a receptor, downstream signaling steps and a response being triggered. A change in form of the signal in every step is not necessary. Note that in many cases the end of this process is regulation of the initiation of transcription. Note that specific transcription factors may be annotated to this term, but core/general transcription machinery such as RNA polymerase should not.

comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the biological process ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose biological process is unknown. Note that when this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the biological process of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code ND, no data, is used to indicate this.

In diplontic organisms there is a life cycle in which the products of meiosis behave directly as gametes, fusing to form a zygote from which the diploid, or sexually reproductive polyploid, adult organism will develop. In diplohaplontic organisms a haploid phase (gametophyte) exists in the life cycle between meiosis and fertilization (e.g. higher plants, many algae and Fungi); the products of meiosis are spores that develop as haploid individuals from which haploid gametes develop to form a diploid zygote; diplohaplontic organisms show an alternation of haploid and diploid generations. In haplontic organisms meiosis occurs in the zygote, giving rise to four haploid cells (e.g. many algae and protozoa), only the zygote is diploid and this may form a resistant spore, tiding organisms over hard times."

Binding may occur as a sequence specific interaction or as an interaction observed only once a factor has been recruited to the DNA by other factors." [GOC:jl, GOC:txnOH, SO:0005836]
comment: The word \"promoter\" is used variously in the literature to describe the core promoter specifically or the entire proximal regulatory region (excluding any distal enhancers) including both the core promoter and the upstream region where activating transcription factors such as Gal4 in S. cerevisiae or catabolite activator protein (CAP) in E. coli bind. To minimize ambiguity in the use of the word \"promoter\" in GO, we have chosen the phrase \"transcription regulatory region\" in order to refer to all of the regulatory regions. Regulatory regions in the DNA which control initiation may include the \"core promoter\" where the basal transcription machinery binds, the \"core promoter proximal region\" where regulatory factors other than the basal machinery bind, and \"enhancer\" regions which are typically more distal from the core promoter. There are also additional regulatory regions, in both the DNA and the RNA transcript, which regulate elongation or termination of transcription. ANNOTATION NOTE: Regarding annotation to \"transcription regulatory region DNA binding\" (GO:0044212) and any of its is_a children, note that annotation to these terms specifies DNA binding only without any statement about transcription factor activity. To make an annotation about a function of transcription factor activity, consider \"sequence-specific DNA binding transcription factor activity\" (GO:0003700) or its is_a children which have has_part relationships to the appropriate kind of \"transcription regulatory region DNA binding\".

It contains a single-pass transmembrane domain and that show distinct expression on early hematopoietic precursors and vascular-associated tissue. Acts as a scaffold that presents selectin carbohydrate ligands in a clustered, tissue specific manner to allow for higher avidity interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells during the inflammatory process. In common with related sialomucins (endoglycan and podocalyxin), the extracellular region is dominated by an N-terminal mucin-like domain, which is densely substituted with sialylated O-linked carbohydrates. The mucin-like region is followed by a cysteine-containing and presumably globular domain. This domain may fold into an immunoglobulin-like structure as the positions of 2 of the cysteines are conserved in the C2 set of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The cytoplasmic domain is around 73-76 residues long and highly conserved." [PMID:16720896, PMID:8983065]

def: "A protein that is an alpha subunit of integrin. A hallmark of this class is the presence of a von Willebrand factor type A domain (PF00092) (I-domain) of approximately 200 amino acid residues at the N-terminus, which confers divalent cation binding properties. Unlike other integrin alpha proteins, they do not undergo proteolytic cleavage. In common with other types of integrin alpha proteins, they are composed of a long N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. Integrins are heterodimers of an alpha and a beta subunit. They are a structurally elaborate family of adhesion molecules that transmit signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane by undergoing large-scale structural rearrangements. By regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, integrins participate in a wide-range of biological interactions including development, tissue repair, angiogenesis, inflammation and hemostasis."

It is composed of an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane segment and two tandem intracytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase domains. Contains 1 to 3 copies of the Fibronectin type III domain (PF00041) followed by two copies of the Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PF00102) domain. CD45 regulates signal transduction and lymphocyte activation by specific association with receptor molecules on T and B cells. Multiple isoforms of CD45 (180-235 kDa) can be generated asna result of alternative splicing of three variable exons 4(A), 5(B) and 6(C), encoding sequences at the N-terminal extracellular domain of the molecule."

comment: Category=family. Integrins are heterodimeric complexes of an alpha and a beta subunit. They are a structurally elaborate family of adhesion molecules that transmit signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane by undergoing large-scale structural rearrangements. By regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, integrins participate in a wide-range of biological interactions including development, tissue repair, angiogenesis, inflammation and hemostasis.

def: "Oval or bean shaped bodies (1 - 30 mm in diameter) located along the lymphatic system. Lymph nodes are garrisons of B, T, and other immune cells. Lymph nodes are found all through the body, and act as filters or traps for foreign particles. They contain white blood cells that use oxygen to process. Thus they are important in the proper functioning of the immune system. The lymph node is surrounded by a fibrous capsule, and inside the lymph node the fibrous capsule extends to form trabeculae. The substance of the lymph node is divided into the outer cortex and the inner medulla surrounded by the former all around except for at the hilum, where the medulla comes in direct contact with the surface. Thin reticular fibers, elastin and reticular fibers form a supporting meshwork called reticular network (RN) inside the node, within which the white blood cells (WBCs), most prominently, lymphocytes are tightly packed as follicles in the cortex. Elsewhere, there are only occasional WBCs. The RN provides not just the structural support, but also provide surface for adhesion of the dendritic cells, macrophages and lymphocytes. It allows for exchange of material with blood through the high endothelial venules and provides the growth and regulatory factors necessary for activation and maturation of immune cells[WP]."

def: "a myogenic muscular organ found in the cardiovascular system. It is responsible for pumping blood throughout the blood vessels by repeated, rhythmic contractions. The vertebrate heart is composed of cardiac muscle, which is an involuntary striated muscle tissue found only in this organ, and connective tissue. Primitive fish have a four-chambered heart; however, the chambers are arranged sequentially so that this primitive heart is quite unlike the four-chambered hearts of mammals and birds. The first chamber is the sinus venosus, which collects de-oxygenated blood, from the body, through the hepatic and cardinal veins. From here, blood flows into the atrium and then to the powerful muscular ventricle where the main pumping action takes place. The fourth and final chamber is the conus arteriosus which contains several valves and sends blood to the ventral aorta. The ventral aorta delivers blood to the gills where it is oxygenated and flows, through the dorsal aorta, into the rest of the body. (In tetrapods, the ventral aorta has divided in two; one half forms the ascending aorta, while the other forms the pulmonary artery. In the adult fish, the four chambers are not arranged in a straight row but, instead, form an S-shape with the latter two chambers lying above the former two. This relatively simpler pattern is found in cartilaginous fish and in the more primitive ray-finned fish. In teleosts, the conus arteriosus is very small and can more accurately be described as part of the aorta rather than of the heart proper. The conus arteriosus is not present in any amniotes which presumably having been absorbed into the ventricles over the course of evolution. Similarly, while the sinus venosus is present as a vestigial structure in some reptiles and birds, it is otherwise absorbed into the right atrium and is no longer distinguishable[WP]."

Epidermis, in invertebrates, the outermost layers of skin of up to 30 layers of stratified squamous epithelium.
comment: Zebrafish epidermis consists only of living cells unlike terrestrial vertebrates in which dead, keratinized cells are present. In terrestrial vertebrates the epidermis often forms an outer keratinized or cornified layer, the stratum corneum. Interaction between the epideris and dermis gives rise to feathers (birds), hair and mammary glands (mammals), teeth and scales (placoid: chondrichthyans; cosmoids, ganoid, cycloid in bony fishes).

For example, XAO includes liver as part of XAO:0000125 alimentary system, so we assume this class is the more generic class

comment: H&W - a vascularized, supporting skeletal tissue, which also can form ectopically outside the skeleton. Bone consists of cells and a mineralized extracellular matrix that is permeated by canals (canaliculi) that contain osteocyte processes (Plate 2). Bone is deposited by bone-forming cells (osteoblasts), which, when they cease dividing, transform into osteocytes. The first bone matrix deposited is unmineralized and is known as osteoid (Plate 3). Subsequently, osteoid is impregnated with hydroxyapatite to form the mineralized tissue we know as bone, a tissue that is modeled, remodeled, and/or removed by mono- or multinucleated osteoclasts (and sometimes by osteocytes)

comment: GO says gut is region of DT, from intestines to anus. ZFA treats as synonym for alimentary canal, and treats it as the sum of DT + organs (ZF has no term from stomach). GO says intestines to anus (excludes stomach and esophagus). MA appears to agree with GO (stomach and esophagus are not parts). FMA includes stomach and esophagus as parts of gut -- the FMA divides gut into lower and upper GI tract; it's not clear if this is exhaustive (small intestine is in neither), but lower GI tract may correspond better to the GO definition. NOTE: GO now changed, see sf id in def xref. Note that FMA also has a term 'gastrointestinal tract', but this includes the liver

def: "The lymphatic system in vertebrates is a network of conduits that carry a clear fluid called lymph. It also includes the lymphoid tissue through which the lymph travels. Lymphoid tissue is found in many organs, particularly the lymph nodes, and in the lymphoid follicles associated with the digestive system such as the tonsils. The system also includes all the structures dedicated to the circulation and production of lymphocytes, which includes the spleen, thymus, bone marrow and the lymphoid tissue associated with the digestive system (Wikipedia)."

comment: We follow FMA and MA in distinguishing between lymphatic system and lymphoid system, with lymhoid tissue part of the non-lymphatic component, although these terms are often used interchangeably. We assume the ZFA term lymphatic tissue actually corresponds to the broader class (e.g. ZFA lymph node in the ZFA lymphatic system). See tracker for more comments.

comment: In birds, the trachea runs from the pharynx to the syrinx, from which the primary bronchi diverge. Swans have an unusually elongated trachea, part of which is coiled beneath the sternum; this may act as a resonator to amplify sound. In some birds, the cartilagenous rings are complete, and may even be ossified. In amphibians, the trachea is normally extremely short, and leads directly into the lungs, without clear primary bronchi. A longer trachea is, however found in some long-necked salamanders, and in caecilians. While there are irregular cartilagenous nodules on the amphibian trachea, these do not form the rings found in amniotes. The only vertebrate to have lungs, but no trachea, is Polypterus, in which the lungs arise directly from the pharynx.

comment: note that many anatomy ontologies consider this synonymous with digestive system. here we follow MA in dividing digestive system into gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary. hepatobiliary includes the liver and biliary tract. species-specific AO classes are categorized according to whether liver is included. For example, XAO includes liver as part of XAO:0000125 alimentary system, so we assume this class is the more generic class. We have one entity that is part of both gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary systems: hepatopancreatic ampulla

comment: Note that adjacent_to as thus defined is not a symmetric relation, in contrast to its instance-level counterpart. For it can be the case that Cs are in general such as to be adjacent to instances of C1 while no analogous statement holds for C1s in general in relation to instances of C. Examples are: nuclear membrane adjacent_to cytoplasm; seminal vesicle adjacent_to urinary bladder; ovary adjacent_to parietal pelvic peritoneum.

comment: Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1. Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus.

def: "q1 reciprocal_of q2 if and only if : q1 and q2 are relational qualities and a phenotype e q1 e2 mutually implies a phenotype e2 q2 e." [PATOC:CJM]
comment: There are frequently two ways to state the same thing: we can say 'spermatocyte lacks asters' or 'asters absent from spermatocyte'. In this case the quality is 'lacking all parts of type' - it is a (relational) quality of the spermatocyte, and it is with respect to instances of 'aster'. One of the popular requirements of PATO is that it continue to support 'absent', so we need to relate statements which use this quality to the 'lacking all parts of type' quality.

comment: PATO divides qualities between normal (monadic, singly-occurring) qualities and relational qualities. Relational qualities stand in the 'towards' relation with respect to some additional entity. For example, The sensitivity of an eye towards red light. In some cases we want to represent a quality such as 'protruding' in both monadic and relational branches. We use this relation to link them.
