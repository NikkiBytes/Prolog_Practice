---+ Visualizing ontologies

For some examples, see:

  * http://berkeleybop.org/obo/FBbt:eye

The ontol package includes a number of writer modules. On of these,
ontol_writer_dot, provides a flexible way of generating dot files from
a subset of an ontology. These can then be fed into a number of
programs, including GraphViz.

---++ Quick Start

Generate a dot file:

==
blip -r cell -n astrocyte -to dot
==

Generate a png and open it right away:

==
blip -r cell -n astrocyte -to display
==

show only a subset of relations:

==
blip -r zebrafish_anatomy -n eye -rel subclass -rel part_of -rel develops_from -to display
==

multiple ontologies, multiple terms, color coded

==
blip -r zebrafish_anatomy -r uberon -r mouse_anatomy -n retina -n cornea -rel subclass -rel part_of -rel develops_from -to display -u ontol_config_autocolor_by_ontology
==
