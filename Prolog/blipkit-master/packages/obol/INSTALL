---+ Installing Obol

---++ Step 1: Install SWI-Prolog

* http://www.swi-prolog.org

---++ Step 2: Install blip

Download Blipkit from SVN:

* http://www.blipkit.org/svn.html

==
svn co svn+ssh://dev.open-bio.org/home/svn-repositories/blipkit/trunk/ blipkit
==

Install the blip libraries:

==
        cd blipkit
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
==

See blipkit/INSTALL for more information

---++ Step 3: Configure blip and obol

See blipkit/tutorial.txt

Add the following to your ~/.plrc file:

==
user:file_search_path(bio, '/users/me/blipkit/packages/obol/src').
==

(changing to the directory in which you downloaded blip)

add the following to your path:

==
export PATH="${PATH}:/users/me/blipkit/packages/obol/bin').
==

---++ Step 4: Running Obol

For all options:

==
obol -help
==

The following example parses BP for definitions in the BP x CL
cross-product (see
http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/XP:biological_process_xp_cell)

==
obol -r obo/biological_process -r obo/cell -u obol_biological_process_xp_cell obol-parse "belongs(ID,biological_process)"
==

Note that this will be extremely slow. You can configure obol to cache
certain results. This requires a bit of understanding of what is going
on beneath the hood. You can always adapt examples from the GO obol makefile:

* http://www.geneontology.org/scratch/obol_results/Makefile

For example:

==
obol -r obo/biological_process -r obo/cell -u obol_biological_process_xp_cell obol-parse -table_pred user:process5/3 -table_pred user:process/3 -table_pred classdef_parser:any_kind_of/3 -table_pred user:continuant/3 -table_pred ontol_db:subclassT/2 -table_pred user:cell/3 -table_pred user:cell5/3 "belongs(ID,biological_process)"
