    <title>Blipkit: Biomedical LogIc Programming Knowledge Integration Kit</title>
    <section id="About Blip">
      <p>
        Blip is a collection of logic programming modules intended
        primarily for bioinformatics and biomedical applications,
        although it contains some modules which may be of more
        general interest. Blip is intended to be both an application
        library, and a deductive database/query system. Blip is
        written in
        <url to="SWI-Prolog"/>, a
          fast, robust and scalable implementation of ISO Prolog.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blip is <a href="http://www.fsf.org">Free Software</a>,
        available, licensed under the <url to="LGPL"/>.

    <section id="Features">
      <p>Here are some distinguishing characteristics of Blip</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Lightweight</b>. Bloat-free: Blip only has as many modules
          as it needs to do its job.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Fast</b>. 
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Declarative</b>. Say <i>what</i> you want to do, not
          <i>how</i> you want to do it
        </li>
        <li>
          Blip can be <b>Query-oriented</b>: specify your data
          sources and ask your query
        </li>
        <li>
          Blip can be <b>Application-oriented</b>: it is designed to be
          used as an application library used by other bioinformatics tools
        </li>
        <li>
         Mature and fully functional <b>ontology module</b> for
         handling both <url to="OBO"/>-style ontologies and <url
        to="OWL"/> ontologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modules for handling <b>biological sequences</b> and
          <b>sequence features</b>. [currently limited functionality,
          added as needed]
        </li>
        <li>
          A <b>systems biology</b> module for querying pathway and
          interaction data. [currently limited functionality, added as needed]
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Relational database integration</b>. SQL can be viewed as a
          highly restricted dialect of Prolog. Although the SWI-Prolog
          in-memory database is fast and scalable, sometimes it is nice
          to be able to fetch data from an external database. Blip
          contains a generic SQL utility module and predicate mappings
          for the GO database, Ensembl and Chado
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Integration</b> with a variety of bioinformatics <b>file
            formats</b>. SWI-Prolog has a variety of fast libraries for
          dealing with XML, RDF and tabular data files. Blip provides
          bridges from bio file formats encoded using these syntaxes
          into its native models. For other syntaxes, Blip seamlessly
          integrates other packages such as <url to="BioPerl"/> and <url
              to="go-perl"/>. Although these dependencies require extra
              installation, there is no point reinventing the wheel
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Rapid development of web applications</b>. Blip extends <url
          to="SWI-Prolog"/>'s excellent http support with a simple and
          powerful logical-functional-programming style application
          server, <pageref page="serval"/>. This has been used to
          prototype a fully-featured next-generation replacement for
          the GO project <url to="amigo"/> browser.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Scalable</b>. Blip is not intended to be a toy system on
          toy data (although it is happy to be used as a toy if you
          like!). It is intended to be used as an application component
          and a tool operating on real-world biological and biomedical
          data
        </li>
        <li>
          It's <b>free!</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          It's <b>fun!</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
