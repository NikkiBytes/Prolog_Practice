---+ Serval

(*Serv*er-*A*pplication-*L*ogic)
 
Serval is a lightweight web application framework for developing www
interfaces. See lib/serval.pro

Currently serval is bundled with bioprolog, due to shared dependencies
on bioprolog_util. They may be separated in the future (OPEN-Q: should
the shared utils be duplicated or moved into a 3rd library?)

Currently the prototype new amigo app is bundled together with
bioprolog and serval - in future it may be separated

See examples/serval for an example server

Run the script "serval" to start a server (default port 8080)

Serval has no dependencies other than SWI Prolog
